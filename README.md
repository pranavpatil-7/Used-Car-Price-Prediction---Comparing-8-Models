# Used-Car-Price-Prediction---Comparing-8-Models
A Data Mining Project

Determining the price of a used car is a challenging task, as many factors play an important role in deciding a carâ€™s price. The goal of this project is to develop 8 different machine learning models to accurately predict the price of a used car and compare the results of the models. The features of a car are the primary basis of price-prediction. Various learning methods are implemented and evaluated to find which factors contribute the most towards determining the price of a used car and which model gives importance to which features. The results show that XGBoost is the best model for predicting the price of a used car.
